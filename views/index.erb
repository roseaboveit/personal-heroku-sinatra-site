      <h2>Questions Answered</h2>

    <div class='container'>

      <h3>Question 1:</h3>
      <h3>What is your favorite...?</h3>

      <div class='response'>I don't really have favorites. It's not how I'm wired. I have things that I like and dislike and while I can rank which things I dislike decently well, I struggle with ranking things I like. Selecting a favorite is related but even more challenging because it is picking the final victor in the favorite ranking exercise.</div>

      <h3>Question 2:</h3>
      <h3>Where are you from?</h3>

      <div class='response'>I've moved many times in my life but most of the time I've stayed in Northwest Washington. The notable exception is the three months I spent in San Francisco. Places I've lived include: Seattle, Anacortes, Chimacum, Irondale, Sequim, Port Angeles, Parkland, and Redmond.</div>

      <h3>Question 3:</h3>
      <h3>What inspires you?</h3>

      <div class='response'>There are many things that inspire me. I will come back to this question and add in all sorts of things that inspire me. Perhaps I will put in some books. Or perhaps I will name some of my favorite heros. Perhaps I'll talk about the strange effect of listening to Scroobius Pip.</div>
