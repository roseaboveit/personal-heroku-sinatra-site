  <h4>Why I went:</h4>
  <p>The leader had introduced the idea at Seattle.rb and I had been confused and was interested in figuring out what it was all about. I also found it convenient that it was going to be located at Ada.</p>

  <h4>Who I met:</h4>
  <p>I met a lot of people, though I have forgotten many of their names. It was good to reconnect with Colette and to meet Kamila StÄ™pniowska, the founders of the event. There were also several attendees who were looking at applying to Ada. It was fun to chat with them at the gathering after the event.</p>

  <h4>What I learned:</h4>
  <p>Kerri gave a great talk about code metrics which allowed me to better contextualize the concept.</p>
  
  <h4>What I want to know more about:</h4>
  <p>I'm looking forward to using more code metrics and developmer metrics in general. I like numbers and using measurements. At this point it is hard to develop a good sense of what I need to do because I'm still so new to coding and just getting something that works is so difficult.</p>
