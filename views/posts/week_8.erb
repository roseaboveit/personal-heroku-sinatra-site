<h3>Program Recap: 2 Month Reflection</h3>
<h3>December 10th, 2013</h3>
<div class="response">
  <p>It has only been two months and yet so much has been done. It is time to take a moment to reflect on the progress and look ahead to the future. There has been a <a href="http://www.readysetrails.com/index.php/181/this-is-why-learning-rails-is-hard/">diagram</a> going around twitter about why learning rails is so hard. Basically there are just so many pieces. When I think about that diagram I also think about <a href="http://www.dungeonsanddevelopers.com">another site</a> I found looking at a programmer from a role-playing game sort of numerical perspective. These sites combined show how I see my roadmap at the moment.</p>

  <p>I now think of this industry as having a lot of pieces each of which have mastery point levels. I tend to think of it as like 10 points per mastery category. Looking at the Rails diagram it is both overwhelming and encouraging. After two months there is little that I can say I've mastered but there is much that I can say I've started and gained a few points in. I look out over all that I have been exposed to and have mixed feelings. On the one hand I am concerned that I have not mastered the aspects I've been exposed to. I'm used to picking things up really quickly and to have to cover the same topics a few times is new to me. On the other hand the landscape is huge and while I have little mastery I have a lot of exposure. I am almost to the point where I could painstakingly teach myself and become a productive developer. I'm really excited that it won't come to that yet. I have another 4 months of in class instruction and 6 months of internship before I need to have enough points for regular full time employment.</p>

  <p>Thinking about the breadth of the landscape when it comes to technologies and the depth within which one could dedicate oneself, it becomes easy to see how diverse developers become. No one has the same experience. Everyone invests their points in different ways. I'm excited over the next few months to be gaining enough points to feel like I can really make a difference. There are so many great projects in the world. Great companies using technology to make things better. Great organizations that could do more good with a little tech help. Great open source projects that make people's lives better.</p>

  <p>Over the break I got an email from <a href="http://www.happycounts.org">The Happiness Initiative</a>. It mostly just talked about what they've been up to but it also had a link to some <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JPeQHAqQafms9I1IeRIKPNqtE5mjnMK9zdfW8wHw6-o/edit">tech needs</a> they had. I was particularly inspired to look at the project requirements. I understood all the requirements. While I might not be ready to actually develop this project, especially not at the speed that they would want, I see this as a project that I could take on in the future. I can feel my programming powers growing and am excited for all the exciting things that my future self is going to make.</p>
