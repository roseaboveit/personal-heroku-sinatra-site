<h3>Have Questions</h3>
<div class="response">
  <p>At Ada Developers Academy we've been doing a lot of interviews lately. Everyone who has ever had an interview knows how nerve-wrecking they can be. Here at Ada we have a very unique opportunity to practice our interviewing. First of all, the program is designed such that we are all competent novice developers who will succeed at the internship and we've all been programming for only six months. This means that in a technical sense there isn't as much difference between interviewees as there would be in a normal interview. This actually takes a lot of pressure off of the interview process. Secondly, we are all interviewing with all of the companies that chose to participate. This gives us a lot of experience in a short period of time, allowing us to quickly adjust our technique and learn from our mistakes.</p>

  <p>One of the things that really struck me in this process is how important it is for me to have questions. Some of the interviewers were especially interested in my questions and making sure that I had a chance to really get a sense of the company. Their interest in my questions also sent a message that they were interested in me as a person to a level that was deeper than the personal questions they asked me. Interviewers tend to have some stock questions to start with and they can be hard to ask in a comfortable, non-robotic fashion. It is with your questions that you can really personalize the interview and more easily turn it from an interview to a conversation. Your questions are also the part of the interview you have the most control over. You can practice them and be prepared with follow-ups that open up the conversation.</p>

  <p>I actually recommend that you come up with a ton of questions but don't have any of them written down. Run through the whole list before you go into the interview but then let your gut guide you about what is most important to learn about the company at the time that you get to ask your questions.</p>

  <p>I'm actually struggling with the idea of transferring my new understanding of this concept. It is one of those things that you can tell someone but it is hard to really understand until it clicks. A company wants more than just a cog. I had been confused with my last few jobs that the interviews were almost non-existent. I now understand that it was because the work I was doing was relatively uniform. I was easily replaceable. As I become qualified for more specialized work, who a person is becomes more important. Culture fit becomes more important. What teams you work best with becomes more important. Who YOU are becomes more important. As someone moving from the former type of work to the latter this can be a strange. I recall something Erica Olavarria from Marchex said when we toured their company. She said, "You are worth more than you think you are." It is true. In this creative, knowledge-based and team-based industry each person has immense power to create value. That value is greatest when a person is where they are supposed to be.</p>

  <p>But where are you supposed to be? This is a big question. <a href="https://twitter.com/ln1draw">Ellen Wondra-Lindley</a> held a great panel on culture fit here at Ada Developers Academy and I hope to write a reflective blog post about it to share what I learned with all of you. What I came out of that panel with most though was a sense that culture fit matters and isn't just about being the sort of person that fits well with a company but finding out whether a company is a good fit for you as a person. Your questions of them is a good opportunity to figure out that fit.</p>

  <p>With this understanding I finally understand why people say you should always have questions for your interviewer. If you don't, you are sending the message that you don't care what the company is so long as they give you a paycheck. You are saying that the details of the work environment are irrelevant. This reflects badly on you because it leads them to believe that you are not invested in finding the best place for you to work. It means that you might be desperate and be willing to work on a team that would be bad for you personally. It means that the differences between this company and the company down the road are irrelevant to you and you could just as easily go somewhere else.</p>
