<h3>Week 3 Reflection</h3>
<h3>Ada Developers Academy</h3>
<div class="response">
  <p>So it has been another exciting week at Ada Developers Academy. There are a lot of great firsts but also a lot of pieces that are starting to feel routine. I'm excited to see how new adventures become routine and make room for even more adventures.</p>

  <h4>Routines</h4>

  <p>I think I am starting to handle the amount of content we are being presented with and the length of time we are spending on it. It was a bit rough this week at parts but I have come through it and feel that I will continue to build more stamina as I practice and keep working.</p>
  <p>Git. I feel much more comfortable now with a lot of the basic skills of git and the thought of doing things with it is no longer painful.</p>
  <p>Teaching Assistants. We have such great teaching assistants who come to help us out. They are also around to give us a greater diversity of developers to talk to and get the feel of the industry through them. This has been really nice. It has been interesting to see different programmers get excited about different aspects of programming.</p>

  <h4>New Adventures</h4>

  <p>Longer projects. Up until this point each project was a one day project that we could extend if we wanted to. This week the project was a week long project with a partner. It was interesting to spend so much time with the same person. This had a lot of ramifications. It helped us to appreciate all the different types of communication challenges that exist, particularly with newbie programmers. It also helped us start to get a feel of different programming styles. One major division that came up in our stand-ups this week was the difference between "talk-through-it" programmers and "stop-and-think" programmers. I'm a "stop-and-think" programmer. Another difference can be the auditory vs visual means of conveying information. Also, within the realm of visual the differences between code, pseudocode, and diagrams as means of explanation. Within all this diversity it is important to remember that we are in a safe and supportive space. I've always thought any differences between me and others I work with are things that just had to cope with and ajust to. While this is true to some extent it is not true to the extent that I feel it. This is just a psychological thing that I need to get over. My needs are as valid as other people's needs even if they are different from other people's needs. Additionally, everyone on the team getting their needs met will make for a stronger team.</p>
  <p>CSVs. This was the central focus of our project this week. We had 4 CSVs which intersected one another in interesting ways. We then made classes and methods that would allow us to access and return data that would be otherwise a pain or impossible to get at. This felt amazingly powerful. It is interesting because I have run across CSVs once or twice. I can't even remember the context but I recall thinking the file type was interesting and then upon opening it wondering how it could possibly be of any use to anyone. I'm now properly introduced to the power of this and I'm thrilled. This feeling of power has been growing over the past three weeks. This feeling of all the things that could be done with a computer and effort. It feels like the sky is the limit.</p>
  <p>As part of our project we were introduced to RSpec and Test Driven Development. It makes a lot of sense to me at a basic level but I'm sure it will take a while before I'm good at writing really good tests in RSpec. Many of the people who I know are developers often get very irritated at coworkers who do not write specifications for their coding projects. I actually think that writing specs will be a lot of fun once I get the hang of it. This makes me feel good about my trajectory as a future developer.</p>

  <h4>Notable things I've been told.</h4>

  <p>I was told by a classmate that I should definitely look into teaching what I learn here. This does not surprise me as I have had done two years of AmeriCorp tutoring, several years of independent tutoring and done a year of graduate work in Education. It seems like in this industry there will be a couple of different ways this can be applied. I assume her comment means that I would be good at mentoring other new developers as they come up and at explaining technologies that I understand to people who's specialties may lie elsewhere. Other than these applications I feel I will need to improve either my writing skills or my public speaking skills in order to effectively teach.</p>
  <p>I was told by Jeff, one of our teaching assistants, that I should write about problems I have and how I solve them. When I stop to think about it this makes a lot of sense. There are a lot of resources to learn computer programming online but when you get stuck you are often stuck until you can find someone who has had the same exact problem. Many turn to the internet to try to solve these problems. As such I may include supplementary blog posts that are about struggles and solutions to struggles in this beginner to intermediate to proficient phases of development as a programmer. I think doing so will also help with the writing skill development I discussed above.</p>
  <p>I was reminded that we will be getting mentors. I'm really excited about it actually. I've been loving the small class size of 16 but I really enjoy the one-on-one attention that a mentor can provide. These mentors will also be representatives of some of the internship opportunities so it may give us greater insight into the second half of our program. This is definitely something to look forward to.</p>
